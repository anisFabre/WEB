  <div class="side">Dragon quest is a game I discovered when I was younger. 
  	<p> It was love at first sight knowing that it is the very famous akira toriyama who is responsible for the design of the characters.</p>
  	 <p> It's a game that really reflects on certain aspects of life. That's why I strongly recommend this opus!</p>

  <div class="main">To sum up this game (I put links to pages if you are interested in the story), We start with our "birth" in the game and then wake up in a boat with a kind of 4-year-old elliopes. 
  	<p> At this point in history it is not known whether the hero's father is actually a king or if it is just a hallucination.</p>    <p> Indeed, by talking to the various sailors populating the boat we learn that our "father" is a famous mercenary.</p> 
  	You should know that in this game we mainly have 3 phases: 

<p>-the first: we're a child. </p> 

<p>-the second: we are adults and we have the choice between 3 women (Pandora, Bianca and Nera) and then we go to our kingdom to govern it.</p> 

<p>-the third: We have been frozen for 10 years and the two children of the hero are now able to accompany him in his quest.</p>
